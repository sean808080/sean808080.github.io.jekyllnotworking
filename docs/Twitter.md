I've been on twitter for longer than I care to remember. I remember signing up for it back in my MTV days.  It seemed to have such promise and I can share stories (another day) where it really blew my mind in what it was able to do for it's users.


That being said, it is now 2022 and the signal to noise ratio has gotten to the point where it's on my list of sites that I'm rethinking my participation on.  Whether it's my mental health and anxiety that grows when reading the timeline or the change in ownership and strategy that seems dubious at best, I'm still on it for now.   

If you're interested, here's a sampling of my latest tweets.
