### The education system is designed to lock you into a long game.  If you lose you quit or drop out.     
  
If you win you get the degree or diploma.    

Along the way are many obstacles:  
- Bad teachers and advisors   
- Tests  
- Assignments   
- Applications
If you treat it as a game that you must play to win it offloads some of the stress and panic of being out of your comfort zone again and again.
