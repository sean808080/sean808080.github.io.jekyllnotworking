# my rusty old resurrected and reinvigorated blog
---
### Introduction
I've decided to restart a website and instead of dealing with website administration, I'll use a few hooks to publish content to the site with a simple tag from from my text editor.

---
### The content
The header of this site has navigation that is based on a sampling of what I make public in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault simply by adding a [YAML](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-yaml) tag
```yaml
share: TRUE
```
Pretty neat huh?
Just by adding that YAML tag to whatever note I'm working on will automatically publish the page to Github and the Jekyll site will automatically get updated.   Why isn't everything this easy?

So, the pages I've shared will either show as a list of links or as a menu option depending on how you're viewing this page.  Enjoy...
