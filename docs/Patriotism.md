# Patriotism 

## Nature and Patriotism

One of the things that I"m sensing more and more is the **[notion of patriotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism "Patriotism on Wikipedia"") and how it manifests** itself in my life.   

Two main things become evident around this:



1. I feel the most patriotic when hiking in the woods and putting my feet down on the same earth that our forefathers walked on.  **We live in a verdant country that is both beautiful and bountiful.  Sometimes we forget this when we are trapped in little boxes in concrete towers.**

2. I feel the least patriotic when listening to others talk about patriotism.  Inevitably, when people are taking about patriotism it is inextricably tied to a goal they have in their language.  Rarely do you hear about someone's take on patriotism for its own sake.  More often that not, it's a poorly veiled excuse at divisive language set up to reinforce the US against THEM.
