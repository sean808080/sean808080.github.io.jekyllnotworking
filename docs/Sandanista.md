## Sandinista
Listening to Sandinista by the Clash, I was instantly transported to the year. I turned 12. 

We were living in Queens, New York, and spending a lot of time looking for an apartment and when we found an apartment, I spent a lot of time avoiding getting to know classmates that I did not like, and I knew would not like me if we got to know each other. 

That was the school year I stayed home, almost the entire year showing up for finals. Because the schools were not great to say the least, I aced the finals, to the teacher's pleasant surprise.
